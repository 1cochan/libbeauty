TODO:
3) A pointer on 64bit will be 64 bits, but it might point to an int32_t type.
   Need to decide how to handle these pointer types.
   A size of a pointer is always 64 bits, but the type it points too can be any type or structure.
   Need to preserve 64bit pointer width at the RTL level.
   Probably try assigning a type to the label.
4) Need to move a lot of the functions in dis64.c into the lib, such as the SSA processing etc.
   Move the functions common to dis64 and dis32. 

WIP
2) Might need to separate out types. One index into the type/struct, and another for the pointer or not.
   Also have a separate out for if it is likely to be signed or unsigned int

DONE
1) For call(), need to search back for the local_regNNNN name, from the param_regNNNN in the function params.
