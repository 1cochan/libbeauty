This needs the following package installed:
libbfd-dev

To see current status do:
In the tree root, do:

./autogen.sh

./configure
make
make install

That will build and install the libs in /usr/local/lib/libbeauty
then:

cd test
make

This will build the test programs dis32, dis64 and bf.

run "./dis64" to see the current working state.
